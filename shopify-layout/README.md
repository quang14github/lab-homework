- Solve this with a `SPA lib/framework`, could be Vue, React, Angular.. your call,
- You could use CSS framework, prefer SCSS.
- Push your work to a Gitlab repo, make sure you show progress with [commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Feel free to use the internet to look up any coding references
- Please do not ask anyone else for help. We want to see how you code, it's more important.
